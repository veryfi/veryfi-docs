<p className="p-text">An SDK is a set of tools (pre-written code) for 
third-party developers (you) to use in your producing application/s using a particular 
framework or platform like the Veryfi API. It’s the fastest and most convenient way to 
engage with an API because all the heavy lifting of authentication, abstraction, etc… are 
all taken care of for you in the language you work in.</p>
